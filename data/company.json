      "description": "HOT works through close collaborative partnerships that include Royal National Springboard Foundation, state schools, boarding schools, students and their families.\n\n The bursary students are identified in the five HOT Member schools by their teachers and Heads according to strict and consistent criteria of income, challenging family circumstances and the potential benefit to that student of a fully funded boarding experience. \n\n We are the only charity in the country to work with state schools in this way, and all our partner schools provide testimony to the positive impact of their collaboration with HOT. Due to the impressive resilience of the students and consistent, personalised support from the HOT team, only two have withdrawn from a place since 2013. The profile of our students demonstrates our commitment to equality, equity, and access to the bursary programme irrespective of gender and race.",

      "description": "The challenge we now face is that our member state schools make a generous donation each year, but in the current economy, the calls on their finances are such that we can no longer accept donations and be ethically comfortable with that. We maintain that there should always be a contribution but not at current levels. \n\n We have a small reserve and could continue to see through the current student cohorts but ultimately close the charity if we cannot find financial support to reduce the contributions from state schools.",
